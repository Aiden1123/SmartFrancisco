This is a very basic Java program that I made to learn how OOP works, it also uses a basic GUI made with swing library.

The program works by creating a database of clients and assigning a special folder to it. Then it is possible to add new clients and assign new accounts to them. 
Program can hold data about balance and rate of each account and it can also be used to add intrest automatically to all accounts.
